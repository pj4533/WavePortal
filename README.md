# WavePortal
Native iOS implementation of the WavePortal tutorial

The intro course on [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) showed you how to build a smart contract, and deploy to the Rinkeby test network. Further, we created a React frontend that interacted with the deployed smart contract.

I wanted to know if I could make an iOS native frontend.
